# LGPNet
This code refered to our proposed Local-Globe Pyramid Network (LGPNet), which employs a local feature pyramid module (LFPM) and a global spatial pyramid module (GSPM) for various buildings feature extraction. Besides, the cross-task transfer learning strategy is proposed to make the LGPNet focus on the buildings, thereby significantly improving the performance.
